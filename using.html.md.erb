This topic describes how to log into, use, and interpret data from Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) Metrics. <%= vars.pws_metrics %>

##<a id='get-started'></a> View an App in PCF Metrics

1. <%= vars.metrics_login %>
1. <%= vars.metrics_viewapps %> 
    <%= image_tag("search-bar.png") %>

From here, you can explore your app metrics by doing the following:

* [Toggle the data views](#toggle)
* [Set the time frame](#time)
* [Filter logs](#logs)

## <a id="toggle"></a>Set the Data Views and Time Scale

### <a id="toggle"></a>Toggle the Data Views

There are four data views: **Events**, **Container**, **Requests &amp; Errors**, and **Latency**. You can select which of these time plots you want to see using the toggles at upper left. Sections below describe each of these views.

### <a id="time"></a>Change the Time Frame

The data views show time along the horizontal axis. The dropdown at upper left sets the time frame shown, for all data views. Choices range from the past two weeks to the past hour.

From within any data view, you can zoom in on areas of interest by clicking and dragging along the horizontal axis.

##<a id='metrics'></a> Interpret the Metrics

Each data view provides a near real-time view of the following data:

### Events 

App events create, update, start, stop, and crash. 

### Container Metrics

Container Metrics displays CPU, memory, and disk usage:

* A spike in CPU might point to a process that is computationally heavy. Scaling app instances can relieve the immediate pressure, but investigate the app to better understand and fix the root cause. 
* A spike in memory might mean a resource leak in the code. Scaling app memory can also relieve the immediate pressure, but look for and resolve the underlying issue so that it does not occur again. 
* A spike in disk might mean the app is writing logs to files instead of STDOUT, caching data to local disk, or serializing huge sessions to disk. 

### Network Metrics

Network Metric displays HTTP requests, errors, and latency:

* A spike in latency means your users are waiting longer to use your app. Scaling app instances can spread that workload over more resources and result in faster response times. 
* A spike in HTTP errors means one or more 4xx or 5xx errors have occurred. Check your app logs for more information. 
* A spike in HTTP requests means more users are using your app. Scaling app instances can reduce the higher latency that may result.

## <a id="logs"></a>View and Filter the Log Source

Logs displays application log data ingested from the [firehose](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-7/loggregator/architecture.html#firehose). PCF Metrics stores application log data for 2 weeks.

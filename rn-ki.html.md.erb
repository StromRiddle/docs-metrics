**Release Date: November 15, 2016**

### Notes
* PCF Metrics 1.0.18 - now with stemcell 3263.8

### Known issues
* For applications that do not have any activity in the past 24 hours, meaning no app events or HTTP requests have been generated, users do not see any data in the UI. They must also refresh their browser after metrics are generated by the use of the app.
* When installing the PCF Metrics tile, the default Resource Config settings for each resource pool may be over-sized for POC/Beta purposes. Adjust them manually to fit your specific environment. 
* All v1.0.x tiles - if the apps dropdown is grayed out
    * Because of an earlier CLI bug, some PCF metrics apps are missing system org guid during tile upgrade/uninstall process which crashes PCF Metrics UI and makes the apps dropdown inaccessible. This is fixed in the 1.1 Metrics tile. A work around for this to remove the user's access to system org using CLI.
* All v1.0.x tiles - if some apps are not accessible from the dropdown even though they are accessible in apps manager
    * If you have apps manager/console admin privilege, you may be able to see apps in apps manager without having space developer role privilege to the spaces in which those apps reside. Metrics however follows permissions directly form cloud controller so if you have cloud.controller.admin privilege, you can see all apps in all spaces in all orgs in PCF Metrics UI. If you have space developer privilege to certain spaces then you can only see the apps in those spaces in PCF Metrics UI.  
* All v1.0.x tiles - SSO authentication is not supported. This feature is added in the 1.1 Metrics tile.

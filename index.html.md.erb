Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) Metrics stores logs, metrics data, and event data from applications running on PCF for the past two weeks. It graphically presents this data to help operators and developers better understand the health and performance of their apps. PCF Metrics includes the following data views:

* **Container metrics**: CPU, memory, and disk usage percentages 
* **Network metrics**: requests per second, HTTP errors per second, and request latency 
* **App events**: create, update, start, stop, and crash
* **Logs**: searchable application logs 

For example, if you see a crash in the events view, you can zoom in on that time and view the corresponding container and network metrics. To help you troubleshoot, you can also see log output for that same time period.
